# Libraries
The Library directory contains the source files for all the libraries that the
Toast-Core uses. Some of these libraries may be modified to work within Toast and/or
its target platforms. All Libraries are kept as close to their original form as
possible.

All library source files / header files are combined with the Toast Core to be used
by modules and the components of Toast itself. In this way, only libraries that permit
redistribution are used.
