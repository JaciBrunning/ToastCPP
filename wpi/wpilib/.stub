This directory serves no purpose except making Microsoft Happy

For Microsoft's C++ Linker to function, the working directory it is launched in has
to exist, even if the output file is in a different directory. As the gradle project
:wpi:wpilib uses the working directory wpi/nt, this folder must exist. For this folder
to be tracked by git, it requires at least one tracked file. I am that file.
